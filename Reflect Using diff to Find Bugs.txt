How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It reduces the amount of code you have to search by only showing what changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily understand where things went wrong, and how you have improved your programs. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    No one always rememers to save, so this saves you from losing your work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because google docs are separate, while coding files are related. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
